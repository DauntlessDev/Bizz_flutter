# Bizz
Bizz is e-commerce app which is built with flutter and dart. This is an app where users can quickly buy clothes that they 
like in seconds. Users can also start their own shop and sell their clothes buy becoming a seller member. The users will be able to shop freely and easily with the app's minimalistic design and color.

This project is still in progress, at the present i just have finished the UI part. I am currently learning mongoDB and how it can be connected to flutter applications. With this, i would be able to improve my development skills. I am also planning to use stripe as the payment gateaway in the future.
